6. Technology & IP (publicly known vs unknown)
Publicly known - Prepit markets itself as leveraging AI to personalize loyalty and automate triggers. - The company positions the product as a cloud-native SaaS solution.
Not publicly disclosed / uncertain - Detailed technology stack (programming languages, cloud provider, database choices, ML frameworks) is not broadly published in press reports or product pages. - Specific patented IP or proprietary algorithms are not listed in public filings.
Practical implications - For enterprise customers concerned about on-premises deployment or data residency, Prepit’s public messaging focuses on cloud SaaS. Any bespoke on-prem or hybrid offering would likely be available only via direct partnership conversations and is not documented publicly.

7. Market, customers & traction
Target market: Restaurants, cafes, quick-service restaurants (QSRs), and F&B chains across Egypt and the broader MENA region — with expansion potential into North America and other regions according to some product testing notes.
Customer type: SME F&B operators and chains seeking loyalty, engagement, and operational automation.
Traction indicators (public signals) - Active social presence (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) and product website. - Regional press coverage and acquisition by Dsquares (Jan 2025) indicate market relevance and exit interest from a sector incumbent.
Known partnerships / customers - Public press and product pages do not provide a detailed customer list or named enterprise partnerships; these are commonly withheld for early-stage B2B startups unless announced.

Pricing: Specific pricing tiers or numbers are not publicly listed; prospective customers are invited to request demos or trials.
Monetization levers: - Monthly/annual SaaS subscription fees - Transactional fees (if integrated payments are offered) - Revenue share on loyalty-driven promotions or merchant marketing - Implementation and onboarding fees for larger accounts
